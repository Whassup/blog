                <P>
                    Have you ever worked in a codebase where each test file was different to the next? Different
                    terminology and grouping of test scenarios; different usages of snapshot testing and
                    react-testing-library.
                </P>
                <P>
                    The effect of this meant wasted time reading a full test file to understand its structure before
                    adding another test case. Creating new tests involved making multiple decisions; should I copy the
                    structure of an existing test or create a new one? Should I use snapshot tests?
                </P>
                <P>
                    We solved this problem by defining guidelines to follow, that make writing tests that are easy to
                    read and write, and would reduced wasted time on decisions.
                </P>

                <P>Our guidelines are as follows:</P>
                <UL>
                    <LI>Group tests by render and user behaviours</LI>
                    <LI>Use a snapshot test to validate render</LI>

                    For example what if our counter example had a tooltip component within it. Usually tooltip
                    components contain a lot of code and logic for figuring out where to position themselves on the
                    page. Within our counter test, we don&apos;t care if the tooltip works â€“ there should already be
                    coverage in for this in our tooltip tests. In that case why let this component get in the way the
                    counter tests or slow us down?{' '}
